Hi, Bored & Broke team ----

Very nice work on this Test Plan.

You have captured the testing philosophy very well.

Nothing to fix for this one.  I like the way you have built in the specific
descriptions.  However, in the industry, you may be required to use numbered
tests, with individual tests for each of the activities you have lumped
together here.  For example, in Section 10.2.1.7, you may be required to
have separate sub-sections for each of the four drop down options.

The module dependencies diagram looks good -- a nice way to show the module
dependencies to insure correct ordering when running the tests!

You have 10% out of 10% for this document, which is an A-plus.

Nice work!
